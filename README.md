# SuperStore Sales Analysis
## Overview
The SuperStore Sales Analysis Dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of sales and its related metrics across three keys dimensions: Sales, Product, and Customer (overview). This dashboard is designed to offer detailed insights into sales generation, year-on-year change, product and customer statistics while allowing users to filter data by parameters such as date, product, category, subcategory, city, state, region, and customer segment. In this project, you will analyze the sales data, highlighting the profits in every dimension, overall sales, and other vital factors impacting the business outcomes. This report is a part of descriptive analysis.

## Aim
The primary goal is to provide actionable insights for the SuperStore by analyzing its historical data, pinpointing areas for enhancement and growth through comprehensive analysis.

## Project Learnings
- Importing the raw master data using the Power BI's data importing method (Import Storage Mode).
- Cleaning the data by importing and transform in Power Query.
- Normalizing the master data by creating multiple tables with relevant fields of different dimensions, which is to help reducing data redundancy and improve querying performance.
- Modeling the data using the star schema technique by creating fact and dimension tables.
- Manipulating the data by aggregating to find key metrics with the DAX expressions.
- Creation of interactive dashboards for SuperStore sales data analysis
- Utilization of complex parameters for drill-down analysis and filter customization
- Data manipulation techniques: connections, table joins, calculations, and user-driven parameters for visualization
- Various visualization types used: bar chart, pie chart, clustered bar chart, line chart, filters, slicers, etc.
  
## Conclusion
This project harnesses Power BI's capabilities to empower stakeholders with a dynamic platform for historical sales data analysis. The derived insights lead to informed decisions and refined sales strategies.
